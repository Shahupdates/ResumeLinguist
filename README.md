# ResumeLinguist
The Resume Linguist is an NLP-driven project aimed at helping users create optimized and effective resumes. The model will understand the context, job domain, and the role to generate an optimized resume. It will take job descriptions as input and generate a suitable resume, tailor-made for that particular job.
